# Chef Certification Study Guides

After the study notes at [anniehedgpeth/chef-certification-study-guides](https://github.com/anniehedgpeth/chef-certification-study-guides)
helped me with studying for the Chef exams, I decided to publish mine as well.

As I did the Basic Chef Fluency Badge ages ago (before the new exam format), I
skipped this.

For now, I only added the Auditing with InSpec notes, as those for Local Cookbook Development and Deploying Cookbooks exist in elsewhere already. I will probably add my personal ones later, as well as some Extending Chef
notes after I passed that one.
